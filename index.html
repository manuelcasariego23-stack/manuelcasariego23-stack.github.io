        <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
        <h2>Analysis of used vehicles market in the U.S.</h2>

        <p>Performed an analysis of the used vehicles market in the U.S. using SQL and Python to extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources. 
          Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends in vehicle prices, sales volumes, and identify key factors influencing the vehicle value.</p>
            <p>Tools</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)</li>
          <li>Streamlit</li>
          <li>git & GitHub</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
         <ul>
          <li>Explore and analyze the used vehicles market in the U.S.</li>
          <li>Identify key factors influencing the vehicle value</li>
          <li>Develop interactive dashboards to present the findings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Metodology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Collection: Gathered data from various sources, including online vehicle listings, market reports, and economic indicators.</li>
          <li>Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used SQL to clean and transform the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy for analysis.</li>
          <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA using Python libraries to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.</li>
          <li>Dashboard Development: Created interactive dashboards using Streamlit to visualize key insights and trends in the used vehicles market.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>

        <h3>Correlations </h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>The price is a multi-variable factor </dt>
          <dd>Price is influenced by multiple factors such as age, mileage, brand, and model.
            there is a clear negative correlation between age and price, moderated by the brand and model.</dd>
          <dt>There is a high dispersion of prices in the market </dt>
          <dd> Exist a wide range of values for similar vehicles, espetialy for vehicles that use gasoline and in sedan models, 
            indicating that other factors such as condition, location, and market demand also play a significant role in pricing.
          </dd>
          <dt>Electric vehicles have a higher average price </dt>
          <dd>Electric vehicles tend to have a higher average price compared to gasoline vehicles, likely due to their advanced technology and environmental benefits.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Visualizations</h2>

        <p><code>Heatmap</code> of the correlation matrix of numerical variables in the dataset: The heatmap 
          shows that vehicle price has a moderate positive correlation with model year (0.44) and a negative 
          correlation with odometer (-0.37), indicating that newer vehicles tend to be more expensive 
          while higher mileage reduces price. Cylinders show a weak positive relationship with price (0.24). 
          The variable days_listed presents no significant correlation with other features.</p>
